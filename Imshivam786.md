project: "Bluetooth Controlled Spider Robot using Arduino"

The spider carrier

It's the arduino code for a smartphone controlled spider robot.Basically it is model of robot which can be contralled by a human master through smartphone.
This robot can be helpfull for short range carrier during military operations.I always amaze robots,it feels very cool and amazing while watch any robot
building videos or reading articles,I will be very happy if get a chance to build my own one.

## Plan

first we are going to assemble the all body parts , for that we need a 3d printed body which we should design.After that we need to fit all 12 servo motors,as 
our robot has four legs we are fitting 3 motors in each leg.We need to fit arduino nano to the Expansion Adapter Breakout Board and need to coonect with our battery.
Afterwards we need to build a charging system for our battery and need to connect Bluetooth Module as well, all these system will be kept at the central bpdy part of robot.
Last but not least we need to load programs to our robot using arduino ide, like the motor position we need to fix a proper position for each motor,and need to program actions
of our robots.Further we need to connect our smartphone with our robot through bluetooth module.
## Budget

| Product         | Supplier/Link                         | Cost   |
| Arduino Nano | ------------------------------------- | ------ |

| Jumper Wires |https://robocraze.com/products/f2m-jumper-wires-20cm-40pcs| $0.6|
|total|                                              |$96.8
The total budget can be vary for building the body structures so our total estimated cost is around $115-$120.
